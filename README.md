**Normal distribution**:

---

# Normal Distribution 
This repository contains the materials for the **Normal Distribution** presentation, as part of **Group 6's assignment**.

## Project Overview
The **Normal distribution** is a continuous probability distribution that models data which clusters around a mean. It is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, commonly used to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. It is characterized by its bell-shaped curve, also known as the **Gaussian curve**.

## Key Features:
- Explanation of the **Normal distribution**
- Relevant mathematical formula and a practical example
- Python code implemented with `numpy` for simulating a **Normal distribution**
- Visual representation of the **Probability Density Function (PDF)**
- A video presentation of the project

## Contents
- `normal_distribution.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the Python code and example
- `normal distribution slides.pdf`: The presentation slides explaining the **Normal distribution**
- `README.md`: This README file

## Video
